        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 carton (32 ounces) whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2-1/2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend, divided</li>
                <li>2-1/2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend, divided</li>
                <li>6 large eggs, beaten, divided use</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons Italian seasoning, divided</li>
                <li>Oil for deep-fat frying</li>
                <li>2-1/2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 jar (24 ounces) marinara sauce, warmed</li>
                <li>1 jar (15 ounces) Alfredo sauce, warmed</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions for al dente. In a large bowl, combine ricotta, 1-1/4 cups Italian cheese blend, mozzarella, 2 eggs and 3 teaspoons Italian seasoning. Drain noodles. If desired, cut off ribboned edges (discard or save for another use). Spread about 1/4 cup filling on each noodle. Starting with a short side, fold each in thirds. Place all on a parchment-lined baking sheet, seam side down. Freeze just until firm, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In an electric skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 375Â°. In a shallow bowl, mix bread crumbs, 2/3 cup Italian cheese blend and 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning. Place remaining 4 eggs in separate shallow bowl. Dip lasagna bundles into eggs, then into crumb mixture, patting to help coating adhere.
            </li>
            <li>Fry bundles in batches until golden brown, 8-10 minutes, turning once. Drain on paper towels. Serve with marinara, Alfredo, the remaining Italian cheese blend and, if desired, additional Italian seasoning.</li>
        </ol>
